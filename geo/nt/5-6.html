                The probability of unions helps us understand the likelihood of either one or more events happening in a probability experiment. The union of two sets is the set of outcomes that belong to either one or both of the events. This concept is useful in many everyday situations where we are interested in the occurrence of one or more events.

                The probability of the union of two events A and B, denoted as P(A ∪ B), is given by the formula:
            </p>
            <p class="text-3xl mt-4 text-yellow-300">
                P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B)
            </p>
            <p class="text-xl text-cyan-300 mt-4">

                    <li>P(A) is the probability of event A occurring</li>
                    <li>P(B) is the probability of event B occurring</li>
                    <li>P(A ∩ B) is the probability of both A and B occurring (the intersection of A and B)</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Example Section -->
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-6 rounded-lg formula-box fade-in mb-8">
            <h2 class="text-3xl mb-4 text-green-400">Example: Drawing Cards from a Deck</h2>
            <p class="text-xl text-cyan-300">
                Let's say we are drawing one card from a deck of 52 cards. We want to know the probability of drawing either a heart or a spade. 
                Let event A be drawing a heart, and event B be drawing a spade. The probability of event A (P(A)) is 13/52 (since there are 13 hearts in a deck), 
                and the probability of event B (P(B)) is also 13/52. Since there is no overlap between hearts and spades, the intersection of A and B (P(A ∩ B)) is 0.
            </p>
            <p class="text-xl text-cyan-300 mt-6">
                Using the formula for the union of two events:
            </p>
            <p class="text-2xl mt-4 text-yellow-300">
                P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B)
            </p>
            <p class="text-xl text-cyan-300 mt-4">
                P(A ∪ B) = 13/52 + 13/52 - 0 = 26/52 = 1/2
            </p>
            <p class="text-xl text-cyan-300 mt-4">
                So, the probability of drawing either a heart or a spade is 1/2, or 50%.

            <h2 class="text-3xl mb-4 text-green-400">Conclusion</h2>
            <p class="text-xl text-cyan-300">
                Understanding the probability of unions is an essential concept in probability theory. It allows us to calculate the likelihood of one or more events occurring together, which can be applied in various everyday situations, such as drawing cards, rolling dice, or predicting outcomes in experiments.
