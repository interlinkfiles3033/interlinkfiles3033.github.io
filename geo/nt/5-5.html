                Understanding conditional probability helps us apply probability theory to everyday situations. In real life, we often encounter events that depend on the outcome of previous events. Conditional probability gives us a way to calculate the likelihood of an event happening given that another related event has already occurred.

            <ul class="space-y-3 text-left text-xl text-blue-300">
                <li><strong>Conditional Probability:</strong> The probability of an event occurring given that another related event has already occurred.</li>
                <li><strong>Probability:</strong> The chance that something will happen, which can be expressed as a fraction, decimal, or percentage.</li>
                <li><strong>Independent Events:</strong> Two events are independent if the occurrence of one event does not affect the probability of the other.</li>
                <li><strong>Dependent Events:</strong> Events where the outcome of one event influences the outcome of another event.</li>

            <h2 class="text-3xl mb-4 text-green-400">Example: Drawing Cards from a Deck</h2>
            <p class="text-xl text-cyan-300">
                Imagine you're drawing two cards from a standard deck of 52 cards. The first card is drawn, and it's a red card (hearts or diamonds). What is the probability that the second card you draw is also a red card, given that the first card was red?
            </p>

            <div class="mt-6">
                <p class="text-xl text-cyan-300">
                    The probability of drawing a red card on the first draw is 26/52, since there are 26 red cards in the deck. After drawing the first red card, there are now 25 red cards left and only 51 cards total. So, the conditional probability of drawing a red card on the second draw is:
                </p>
                <p class="text-2xl mt-4 text-yellow-300">
                    P(Second Red | First Red) = 25/51
                </p>
            </div>
            <p class="mt-4 text-xl text-cyan-300">
                This is an example of dependent events because the outcome of the first event (drawing a red card) affects the probability of the second event (drawing a red card again).
            </p>

            <p class="text-xl text-cyan-300">
                Everyday situations, like drawing cards from a deck or making predictions based on prior outcomes, can often be modeled using conditional probability. By understanding how one event affects the likelihood of another, we can make more informed decisions. Conditional probability is a powerful tool that helps us navigate uncertainty in daily life.
