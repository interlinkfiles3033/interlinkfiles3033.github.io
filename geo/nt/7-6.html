                The **Mean of Means** refers to the average of the means of several samples taken from the same population. It provides a way to estimate the overall population mean using sample data. This concept is fundamental in statistical inference because it shows that, regardless of sample size, the mean of sample means will approach the population mean as the number of samples increases.
                <br><br>
                It also helps in understanding the behavior of sample means in various distributions, particularly in hypothesis testing and the creation of confidence intervals.

            <p class="text-xl text-cyan-300">
                The **Mean of Means** formula is used to find the expected value of the sample means. It helps estimate the population mean by averaging the means of several samples.
                <br><br>
                The **Standard Deviation of Sample Means** is given by the formula:
                <pre class="bg-gray-700 text-white p-4 mt-4 rounded">
Standard Deviation of Sample Means = σ / √n
                </pre>
                Where:
                <ul class="list-disc pl-8 text-lg text-blue-300">
                    <li>**σ** is the population standard deviation.</li>
                    <li>**n** is the sample size.</li>
                </ul>
                The standard deviation of the sample means decreases as the sample size increases, making the sample mean a more accurate estimate of the population mean.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Example Section -->
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-6 rounded-lg formula-box fade-in mb-8">
            <h2 class="text-3xl mb-4 text-green-400">Example</h2>
            <p class="text-xl text-cyan-300">
                Suppose you are analyzing the average height of students at a school. The population standard deviation (**σ**) is 10 cm. You take several samples, each with a size of **n = 25** students. You want to find the standard deviation of the sample means.
                <br><br>
                Using the formula for the **Standard Deviation of Sample Means**:
                <pre class="bg-gray-700 text-white p-4 mt-4 rounded">
Standard Deviation of Sample Means = σ / √n
Standard Deviation of Sample Means = 10 / √25
Standard Deviation of Sample Means = 10 / 5
Standard Deviation of Sample Means = 2
                </pre>
                Therefore, the standard deviation of the sample means is **2 cm**.
            </p>

        <!-- Application of Mean of Means Section -->
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-6 rounded-lg formula-box fade-in mb-8">
            <h2 class="text-3xl mb-4 text-green-400">Application of Mean of Means</h2>
            <p class="text-xl text-cyan-300">
                The **Mean of Means** can be used to estimate the population mean by calculating the mean of multiple sample means. As you take more samples, the mean of the sample means will converge to the true population mean. This is useful for drawing conclusions about the population based on sample data.
                <br><br>
                For instance, if you take several random samples of size 30 from a population, and calculate the mean of each sample, the average of those sample means will give you an estimate of the population mean.

            <h2 class="text-3xl mb-4 text-green-400">Conclusion</h2>
            <p class="text-xl text-cyan-300">
                The **Mean of Means** is an important concept for estimating the population mean using sample data. By understanding the **Standard Deviation of Sample Means**, statisticians can assess how reliable their sample means are as estimates of the population mean. The larger the sample size, the more accurate the sample mean becomes.
