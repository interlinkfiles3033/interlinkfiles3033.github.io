            <p class="text-xl text-cyan-300">
                The **Central Limit Theorem (CLT)** states that as you take more and more samples from a random variable, the distribution of the means of the samples will approximate a normal distribution, regardless of the shape of the original population distribution. This theorem is crucial in statistics because it enables us to make inferences about population parameters, such as the mean, from sample data.
                <br><br>
                As the number of samples increases, the sample means form a distribution that becomes increasingly bell-shaped, making it easier to apply normal distribution techniques for hypothesis testing and confidence intervals.

            <h2 class="text-3xl mb-4 text-green-400">Important Info</h2>
            <p class="text-xl text-cyan-300">
                The **Central Limit Theorem** applies when the sample size is sufficiently large (typically n ≥ 30) and is used to approximate the sampling distribution of the sample mean. Even if the population distribution is not normal, the sample means will be approximately normally distributed.
                <br><br>
                The **mean of the sample means** equals the **population mean**:
                <pre class="bg-gray-700 text-white p-4 mt-4 rounded">
Mean of Sample Means = μ (Population Mean)
                </pre>
                The **standard deviation of the sample means** (also called the **standard error**) is calculated as:
                <pre class="bg-gray-700 text-white p-4 mt-4 rounded">
Standard Deviation of Sample Means = σ / √n
                </pre>
                Where:
                - **σ** is the population standard deviation.
                - **n** is the sample size.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Example Section -->
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-6 rounded-lg formula-box fade-in mb-8">
            <h2 class="text-3xl mb-4 text-green-400">Example</h2>
            <p class="text-xl text-cyan-300">
                Suppose you have a population of students with a mean height of 160 cm and a population standard deviation of 10 cm. If you take random samples of 40 students, the **mean of sample means** will be:
                <pre class="bg-gray-700 text-white p-4 mt-4 rounded">
Mean of Sample Means = μ = 160 cm
                </pre>
                The **standard deviation of the sample means** will be:
                <pre class="bg-gray-700 text-white p-4 mt-4 rounded">
Standard Deviation of Sample Means = σ / √n = 10 / √40 ≈ 1.58 cm
                </pre>
                As you take more samples, the distribution of sample means will approach a normal distribution centered around 160 cm, with a standard deviation of about 1.58 cm.

        <!-- Application of CLT Section -->

            <h2 class="text-3xl mb-4 text-green-400">Application of CLT</h2>
            <p class="text-xl text-cyan-300">
                The **Central Limit Theorem** is widely used in statistical analysis, especially in cases where the population distribution is unknown or not normal. By taking large enough samples (n ≥ 30), statisticians can assume that the sample means will follow a normal distribution. This allows for the application of normal distribution techniques to calculate confidence intervals and perform hypothesis tests.
                <br><br>
                For instance, if you want to estimate the average height of students in a large school, you can take random samples, calculate the sample means, and apply the CLT to approximate the population mean.

            <h2 class="text-3xl mb-4 text-green-400">Conclusion</h2>
            <p class="text-xl text-cyan-300">
                The **Central Limit Theorem** is one of the most important results in statistics because it allows us to make valid inferences about a population based on sample data. Even if the population is not normally distributed, the distribution of sample means will become normal as the sample size increases. This principle underpins many statistical methods, including hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and regression analysis.
