                An **angle** is formed when two rays meet at their endpoints, creating a geometric figure. The **point of intersection** where the two rays meet is called the **vertex** of the angle. Depending on the situation, an angle is often represented with the angle symbol (∠) followed by its vertex.
                <br><br>
                Understanding angles is essential for working with geometric shapes, measuring rotations, and solving problems related to **intersection points**, **parallel lines**, and **perpendicular lines**.

            <h2 class="text-3xl mb-4 text-green-400">Important Info</h2>
            <p class="text-xl text-cyan-300">
                In geometry, angles are fundamental for describing shapes, lines, and various transformations. The main types of angles include:
                <br><br>
                - **Right Angle (90°)**: A perfect right angle.
                - **Acute Angle (less than 90°)**: An angle smaller than 90 degrees.
                - **Obtuse Angle (greater than 90°)**: An angle larger than 90 but less than 180 degrees.
                - **Straight Angle (180°)**: A straight line.
                - **Reflex Angle (greater than 180°)**: An angle larger than 180 degrees but smaller than 360 degrees.
                <br><br>
                Angles are created by two rays, but they are classified based on their measure. **Vertical angles** are always equal, and **adjacent angles** share a side and vertex, making them important in angle relationships.
            </p>

        <!-- Example Section -->
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-6 rounded-lg formula-box fade-in mb-8">
            <h2 class="text-3xl mb-4 text-green-400">Example</h2>
            <p class="text-xl text-cyan-300">
                Let's consider two lines intersecting, creating two pairs of **vertical angles**.
                <br><br>
                When two lines intersect at a point, they create **vertical angles**. These angles are opposite each other and are always congruent. For example:
                <pre class="bg-gray-700 text-white p-4 mt-4 rounded">
Vertical Angle 1 = 120°
Vertical Angle 2 = 120°
                </pre>
                This demonstrates that the two vertical angles are equal, regardless of the angles created by the intersection.
                <br><br>
                **Adjacent angles** are angles that share a common side and vertex. For example:
                <pre class="bg-gray-700 text-white p-4 mt-4 rounded">
Adjacent Angle 1 = 45°
Adjacent Angle 2 = 45°
                </pre>
                These two angles are adjacent, as they share a common side and vertex.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-3xl mb-4 text-green-400">Interactive Example</h2>
            <p class="text-xl text-cyan-300">
                Use a **protractor** to measure the angles formed by the intersection of two lines:
                <ul class="list-disc ml-8 text-xl text-blue-300">
                    <li>Place the protractor on the **vertex** of the intersection.</li>
                    <li>Align the base of the protractor with one of the rays.</li>
                    <li>Measure the angle between the two rays in degrees.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                **Note:** The sum of the angles formed by two intersecting lines is always 360°, as they form a full circle.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-3xl mb-4 text-green-400">Conclusion</h2>
            <p class="text-xl text-cyan-300">
                Angles are essential in geometry for describing the relationships between lines, shapes, and transformations. By understanding **types of angles** such as right, acute, obtuse, and straight angles, as well as concepts like **vertical** and **adjacent angles**, you can solve geometric problems involving intersections, rotations, and reflections. Using tools like the **protractor** allows you to measure angles accurately, aiding in a wide range of geometric applications.
