            <p class="text-xl text-cyan-300">
                The probability of intersection helps determine the likelihood of two events happening simultaneously or together. The intersection represents the common outcomes between two events, often visualized with a Venn diagram. This is a key concept in understanding how two events might be related and how they influence each other in probability experiments.

            <p class="text-3xl mt-4 text-yellow-300">
                P(A ∩ B) = P(A) * P(B | A)

        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-6 rounded-lg formula-box fade-in mb-8">
            <h2 class="text-3xl mb-4 text-green-400">Example: Drawing Cards from a Deck</h2>
            <p class="text-xl text-cyan-300">
                Suppose we are drawing two cards from a deck of 52 cards, without replacement. Let event A be drawing a heart, and event B be drawing a queen. We want to find the probability of drawing both a heart and a queen.
            </p>
            <p class="text-xl text-cyan-300 mt-6">
                We know that:
                - P(A) = 13/52 (since there are 13 hearts in a deck)
                - P(B | A) = 1/51 (since there is one queen of hearts, and there are 51 cards left after drawing one heart)
            </p>
            <p class="text-2xl mt-4 text-yellow-300">
                Using the formula for the intersection of two events:
            </p>
            <p class="text-xl text-cyan-300 mt-6">
                P(A ∩ B) = P(A) * P(B | A)
            </p>
            <p class="text-xl text-cyan-300 mt-4">
                P(A ∩ B) = (13/52) * (1/51) = 13/2652 ≈ 0.0049
            </p>
            <p class="text-xl text-cyan-300 mt-4">
                So, the probability of drawing both a heart and a queen is approximately 0.49%.

            <h2 class="text-3xl mb-4 text-green-400">Conclusion</h2>
            <p class="text-xl text-cyan-300">
                The probability of intersection is a critical concept when dealing with dependent events. It allows us to compute the likelihood of two events occurring together, which is essential for understanding more complex scenarios in probability. Whether drawing cards, rolling dice, or conducting experiments, the intersection of events plays a significant role in analyzing outcomes.
